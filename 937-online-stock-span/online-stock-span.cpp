/*
Intuition:
We need to calculate the stock span for each day's price â€” i.e., the number of consecutive
days (including today) the price was less than or equal to today's price. This is similar to
"Next Greater to Left" problems and is solved using a monotonic stack.

To do this efficiently, we maintain a stack of {price, index} pairs in decreasing order of price.
For each new price, we pop all smaller or equal prices, and compute the span as:
    span = current_index - index of previous higher price.

Algorithm:
1. Maintain a stack of pairs (price, index) in decreasing order of price.
2. For each new price:
   a. Increment index.
   b. Pop elements from the stack while top().price <= current price.
   c. Calculate span = current_index - (stack top index or -1 if empty).
   d. Push (price, index) onto the stack.
3. Return the span.

        int ans=index-(st.empty()?-1:st.top().second);
